# Tatua Ticketing App


## Tatua ticketing app is a web application that allows users to:
```
1. Raise a ticket via the form shown in the image above
2. View all submissions in the data table format shown above
3. Persist data between browser sessions
```

### Below is a short summary on the branches :

| Branch name | 	Description |
|--------------|--------------------|
| part1-memory-storage |	It aims to learn about memory storage and form submissions events|
| part2-session-storage |	It aims to learn about session storage, if data persists between page refreshes and cleared when the browser session ends |
| part3-local-storage |	It aims to learn about local storage, implements logic to load saved data when the page loads and ensures delete operations update both the display and localStorage|

### The local-storage has the additional operations below, it is treated as the main javascript file :
```
1. Data encryption
2. Sorting tickets
3. Filtering tickets
4. Pagination
5. File Restriction
```

### To run the full tatua application do the following :
1. Pull the code to a desired directory
2. Create a key.xml file in the root directory
3. Open a console and run the following code then save the key to the xml file :
```
(async () => {
    const key = await window.crypto.subtle.generateKey(
        { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
        true,
        ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
    );
    const exportedKey = await window.crypto.subtle.exportKey("raw", key);
    const keyBase64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(exportedKey)));
    console.log('Base64 Key:', keyBase64);
})();
```
4. Save the xml file as follows :
```
<key>
    <encryptionKey>qG1kH5zL9xP8vW3mT2rJ7yN4uQ0tI5eA8dF2hK9cX4=</encryptionKey>
</key>
```
5. Install node on your device :
6. Install http server with :
```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```
7. Add SSH conviguration with the following to create an https host(you can leave some fields blank to use the default values) :
```
mkdir ssl && cd ssl
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem
cd ..
http-server -S -C ssl/cert.pem -K ssl/key.pem
```
8. Follow the link generated by http-server
